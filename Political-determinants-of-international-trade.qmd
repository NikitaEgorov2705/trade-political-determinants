# How do politics affect international trade?

**Original study**: **The Political Determinants of International Trade: The Major Powers, 1907–1990 (**[James D. Morrow](https://www.cambridge.org/core/search?filters%5BauthorTerms%5D=James%20D.%20Morrow&eventCode=SE-AU), [Randolph M. Siverson](https://www.cambridge.org/core/search?filters%5BauthorTerms%5D=Randolph%20M.%20Siverson&eventCode=SE-AU) and [Tressa E. Tabares](https://www.cambridge.org/core/search?filters%5BauthorTerms%5D=Tressa%20E.%20Tabares&eventCode=SE-AU)**)**

Data can be accessed on [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/P9UL3O).

It is hard to deny that politics influences international trade. But which geopolitical factors matter the most? In their study, *The Political Determinants of International Trade*, James D. Morrow, Randolph M. Siverson, and Tressa E. Tabares explore this question.

Using 20th-century data on trade volumes among major political powers, the authors test three key arguments about the relationship between politics and trade:

1.  **Political allies trade more**: States with aligned interests are more likely to engage in trade.

2.  **Democracies trade more**: Democratic states are more inclined to trade with one another than with non-democracies.

3.  **Political rivalry reduces trade**: Rivalries, especially in a bipolar system, hinder trade flows between states.

## Data

The dataset includes annual observations of trade flows between all directed pairs of major powers (dyads) from 1907 to 1990, excluding the years during the two world wars and the year immediately following each war. The major powers include the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia and Italy.

# Do democracies trade more?

One of the key assumptions tested in the study is that states with similar political regimes—particularly democratic dyads—are more likely to engage in trade. This hypothesis suggests that shared democratic values foster trust, reduce transaction costs, and create a favorable environment for trade partnerships.\
\
In the study authors code a dyad democratic if both trading states were ranked 6+ on **Gurr's Institutionalized Democracy** scale.

```{r}
trade <- trade %>%
  mutate(Dem = case_when(DEMDL == 0 ~ "Non-democratic dyad",
                         DEMDL != 0 ~ "Democratic dyad"))

trade %>%
  count(Dem) %>%
  kable(
    caption = "Number of observations per dyad type",
    col.names = c("Decade", "Count"),
    align = "lc"
  )
```

```{r}
dyad_summary <- trade %>%
  group_by(DECADE, Dem) %>%
  summarise(total_exports = sum(XIJL, na.rm = TRUE))

volume_dyads <- ggplot(data = dyad_summary,
         mapping = aes(x = DECADE,
                       y = total_exports, fill = Dem))  +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 20), limits=periods) +
  theme_stata() +
  labs(x = "Decade",
       y = "Exports, constant mln $",
       title = "Trade volume: Democratic partners vs. others")

              nrow = 1) +

# Do political rivals trade less?

It is hypothesized that states with poor political relations trade less, as trading with a rival state may be seen as counterproductive and potentially empowering an opponent. Since "rivalry" lacks a direct measure, the authors use a binary proxy variable to indicate whether the states in a dyad experienced **militarized interstate disputes**.

These disputes are recorded as occurring if at least one member of the dyad threatened to use military force against the other.

```{r}
trade <- trade %>%
  mutate(Disputes = case_when(MIDL == 0 ~ "No disputes",
                         MIDL != 0 ~ "Disputes occured"))

trade %>%
  count(Disputes) %>%
  kable(
    caption = "Number of observations per dyad type",
    col.names = c("Dispute occured?", "Count"),
    align = "lc"
  )
```

```{r}
tradeMID_year <- trade %>%
  group_by(Disputes, YEAR) %>%
  summarise(total_exports = sum(XIJL, na.rm = TRUE))


MID <- ggplot(data = tradeMID_year,
              mapping = aes(x = YEAR, y = total_exports, color = Disputes, group = Disputes)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2) +
  theme_stata() +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Volume of exports",
    title = "Exports of dyads: Do political conflicts affect trade?",
    color = "Dispute Status"
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 0.5),
        legend.position = 'bottom')

ggplotly(MID)

```

```{r}
tradeMID_DECADE <- trade %>%
  group_by(Disputes, DECADE) %>%
  summarise(total_exports = sum(XIJL, na.rm = TRUE))

MID_DECADE <- ggplot(data = tradeMID_DECADE,
              mapping = aes(x = DECADE, y = total_exports, fill = Disputes, color = Disputes)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_stata() +
  labs(x = "Decades",
       y = "Volume of exports",
       title = "Exports of dyads: Do political conflicts affect trade?") +
  facet_wrap( ~ Disputes, nrow = 1) +
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 30), limits=periods) +
  theme(legend.position='none')

# Do states with similar interests trade more?

It is commonly argued that states with similar political interests are more likely to trade with each other. Shared interests are expected to incentivize states to engage in economic collaboration, leading to more intensive trade relations.

To measure the similarity of interests, the authors use the **TAU** indicator, which is based on the correlation of their alliance portfolios. TAU ranges from -1 (indicating complete dissimilarity in alliance portfolios) to 1 (indicating perfect similarity in alliance portfolios).

```{r}
TAU_hist <- ggplot(trade, aes(x = TAUL)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 15, fill = "navy", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(x = "TAU Value", 
       y = "Frequency", 
       title = "Distribution of TAU (Common Interests) Values in the Dataset") +
  theme_stata()

ggplotly(TAU_hist)
```

A low TAU value means the two countries in the dyad have very different allies, so they likely have conflicting interests. For example, one might have military agreements with certain countries, while the other has no such agreements, showing they are not closely aligned. A high TAU value means the countries share many of the same allies, indicating they have similar interests and are more likely to cooperate with each other.

\
As we can see on a histogram, the largest portion of the sample has relatively low similarity of allies portfolio (\~ 0.2 - 0.3)

```{r}
TAU_hist <- ggplot(data = trade, aes(x = TAUL, y = XIJL)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", color = "navy", se = FALSE) +
  # geom_smooth(method = "loess", color = "navy", se = TRUE, fill = "lightblue", level = 0.90)
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Similarity of Interests (TAU)", y = "State Exports, mln. constant U.S. dollars)",
       title = "Similarity of Interests Vs. Export Volume")

ggplotly(TAU_hist)
```

# Do military allies trade more?

Countries that are military allies often have stronger economic ties. When two countries are part of the same military alliance, they are expected to trust each other and collaborate more, reducing political risks that might otherwise hinder trade.

The authors use a binary variable to indicate whether countries in a trading dyad have a formal alliance or not. Additionally, they introduce an interaction term to account for the global power structure, distinguishing between a **Multipolar world** (before World War II) and a **Bipolar world** (after World War II). Hypothetically, alliances in a multipolar world are not expected to significantly impact trade, whereas alliances in a bipolar world are thought to have a stronger positive effect.

```{r}
trade <- trade %>%
  mutate(
    Alliance = case_when(
      ALLIAL == 0 ~ "No alliance",
      ALLIAL != 0 ~ "Alliance"
    ),
    Period = case_when(
      as.numeric(as.character(YEAR)) < 1947 ~ "Pre-WW2",
      as.numeric(as.character(YEAR)) >= 1947 ~ "Post-WW2"
    )
  )

alliance_summary <- trade %>%
  group_by(Alliance, Period) %>%
  summarize(count = n(), .groups = "drop")
```

```{r}
alliance_summary$Period <- factor(alliance_summary$Period, levels = c("Pre-WW2", "Post-WW2"))

ALLIAL_barplot <- ggplot(alliance_summary, aes(x = Period, y = count, fill = Alliance)) +

       x = "Period", y = "Count of Dyads") +

# Gravity Model of International Trade

For testing the hypotheses, the authors employ a **gravity model of international trade**, augmented with variables for the political determinants discussed earlier (democracy, rivalry, alliances, and similarity of interests). The gravity model is a well-established framework in economics that predicts the volume of trade flows between two countries based on three core components:

1.  **Economic Size**:

    -   Measured as **Gross National Product (GNP)** in this study, economic size captures the production and consumption potential of the trading countries.

    -   Larger economies are expected to trade more due to their greater capacity to produce goods and services (supply side) and their higher consumer demand (demand side).

2.  **Physical Distance**:

    -   Distance acts as a proxy for trade costs, including transportation expenses, communication barriers, and time lags.

    -   Greater distances typically reduce trade flows, as higher costs make trade less competitive.

3.  **Population**:

    -   The authors include population to account for its dual role:

        -   **Supply Side**: Larger populations may increase production capacity, especially in labor-intensive industries.

        -   **Demand Side**: Larger domestic markets may reduce the need for trade, as countries with sizable populations can meet more of their needs internally.

    -   In this study, population is expected to negatively correlate with trade, reflecting the potential self-sufficiency of larger nations.

The authors extend the model by introducing political variables to examine how non-economic factors influence trade flows. These additions enable the gravity model to test hypotheses about how democracy, political rivalry, alliances, and shared interests shape international economic relationships.
